CODING STANDARDS:
- Use TypeScript (but strict: false for now)

- Use 'use client' directive for client components
- Keep components in /components folder
- Keep types in /types folder

DO NOT:
- Add unnecessary dependencies
- Refactor unless asked
- Change unrelated code
- Use strict TypeScript without being asked

TESTING:
- Run npm run build to check for errors before pushing
- Test locally with npm run dev

AFTER EVERY CHANGE:
1. Run `npm run build` to check for errors
2. Run `npx kill-port 3000` to stop any running dev server
3. Run `npm run dev` to start fresh on localhost:3000
4. Always use port 3000 — never let it increment to 3001, 3002, etc.

DEPLOYMENT:
- Push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys
- Environment variables are in Vercel dashboard
