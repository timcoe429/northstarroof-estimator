# Cedar Shake & Shingle Roof System

## Overview
Natural cedar roofing ΓÇö either cedar shakes (thicker, hand-split or machine-split) or cedar shingles (thinner, machine-sawn). Common in the Roaring Fork Valley for mountain aesthetic. Cedar requires proper ventilation and underlayment for longevity at altitude.

## Primary Materials
- Cedar products are NOT currently in the price list ΓÇö material pricing comes from supplier quotes or custom entry
- Common items to expect: cedar shakes/shingles (per bundle or square), cedar hip & ridge, cedar starter
- The AI should allow the user to input cedar material costs or upload a supplier quote

## Underlayment
- **OC Titanium PSU 30** ΓÇö ALWAYS (per universal rules)
- **SolarHide Radiant Barrier** ($340/roll) ΓÇö ALWAYS for cedar (non-metal), IN ADDITION to PSU 30
- Cedar may also require breather underlayment or spaced sheathing for proper ventilation ΓÇö note to user if relevant
- Do NOT select Sharkskin (replaced by SolarHide)
- Do NOT select Grace Ice & Water High Temp as primary underlayment
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (metal only)

## Fasteners
- Cedar typically uses stainless steel nails to prevent corrosion/staining
- **1.75" SS RS Coil Nail** ($350/box) ΓÇö Stainless steel ring shank, recommended for cedar at high altitude
- Note: Cedar-specific nail items may need to be added to the price list

## Labor
- **Default crew: Hugo**
- Select Hugo rate based on predominant pitch:
  - Hugo (standard): $550/sq for pitches below 8/12
  - Hugo (lower pitch): $650/sq for 8/12 to 11/12
  - Hugo (12/12 pitch): $750/sq for 12/12 pitch roofs
- Only select Alfredo ($1,136/sq), Chris ($750/sq), or Sergio ($129/sq) if explicitly specified in job description

## Flashing

### Standard Flashings
- D-Style Eave ($46/ea), D-Style Rake ($46/ea)
- Valley ($83/ea), Step Flash ($365/box)
- Headwall or Pitch Change ($36/ea)

Standard aluminum is the default. Copper is only selected when customer explicitly requests it for aesthetic purposes (copper pairs well with cedar visually).

Do NOT select Flat Sheet unless explicitly requested — it is for custom fabrication only.

## Snow Retention
- **Snow Guard** ($7.00/ea) ΓÇö Snow guards, NOT snow fence
  - Same calculation: eave_length ├ù rows_by_pitch
  - Rows: 1-4/12 = 1, 5-7/12 = 2, 8-10/12 = 3, 11-12/12 = 4
- Labor: **Snowguard Install** ($5.00/ea)

## Special Considerations for Aspen/High Altitude
- Cedar at 8,000'+ elevation needs excellent ventilation to prevent moisture damage
- Stainless steel fasteners are strongly recommended (galvanized can stain cedar)
- Fire treatment may be required by local code ΓÇö check Pitkin County requirements
- Cedar has a shorter lifespan at altitude than in coastal/lowland areas ΓÇö worth mentioning to clients

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (metal only)
- Do NOT use galvanized nails if stainless is available (staining risk)
- Do NOT select snow fence (that's for metal roofs only)
- Do NOT forget that cedar material items need to be added to the price list or entered as custom items
