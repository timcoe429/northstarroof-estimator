# Asphalt Shingle Roof System

## Overview
Asphalt shingles are the most common residential roofing material. Two sub-types determine nail selection:
- **Presidential** ΓÇö Premium architectural/designer shingle (thicker, heavier)
- **Basic/Standard** ΓÇö Standard architectural or 3-tab shingle

## Primary Materials
- Shingle products are NOT currently in the price list ΓÇö user will add specific shingle items or enter custom items
- The AI should note this gap and allow the user to input shingle material costs

## Sub-Type Selection
The job description or user selection determines the sub-type:
- Keywords for Presidential: "presidential", "designer", "luxury", "premium shingle"
- Keywords for Basic: "shingle", "asphalt", "architectural", "3-tab", "composition"
- Default to basic if unclear

## Underlayment
- **OC Titanium PSU 30** ΓÇö ALWAYS (per universal rules)
- **SolarHide Radiant Barrier** ($340/roll) ΓÇö ALWAYS for asphalt (non-metal), IN ADDITION to PSU 30
- Do NOT select Sharkskin (replaced by SolarHide)
- Do NOT select Grace Ice & Water High Temp as primary underlayment
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (metal only)

## Fasteners
- **Presidential**: 1┬╛" non-ringshank nails (item may need to be added to price list)
- **Basic/Standard**: 1┬╜" non-ringshank nails (item may need to be added to price list)
- **1.25" Plasticap Pail** ($40/pail) ΓÇö For underlayment
- Note: Specific non-ringshank nail items do not currently exist in the price list. Flag this to the user.

## Flashing
Standard aluminum flashing (copper is less common with asphalt but can be specified):
- D-Style Eave ($46/ea), D-Style Rake ($46/ea)
- Valley ($83/ea), Step Flash ($365/box)
- Headwall or Pitch Change ($36/ea), Flat Sheet ($120/ea)
- Hip & Ridge ($25/ea)

## Snow Retention
- **RMSG Yeti Snowguard** ($7.00/ea)
  - Same calculation: eave_length ├ù rows_by_pitch
  - Rows: 1-4/12 = 1, 5-7/12 = 2, 8-10/12 = 3, 11-12/12 = 4
- Labor: **Snowguard Install** ($5.00/ea)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do NOT select ring shank nails for asphalt (those are for synthetic systems)
- Do NOT confuse Presidential nail spec (1┬╛") with basic nail spec (1┬╜")
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (metal only)
