# Brava Composite Tile Roof System

## Overview
Brava is a synthetic composite slate tile system. Lightweight, durable, Class A fire rated, 50-year limited warranty. Premium product for residential applications in the Roaring Fork Valley.

## Primary Materials
- **Brava Field Tile** ($43.25/bundle) — Main roofing tile
- **Brava Starter** ($54.35/bundle) — Starter course along eaves and rakes
- **Brava H&R** ($75.29/bundle) — Hip and ridge caps for pitches BELOW 8/12
- **Brava H&R High Slope** ($75.29/bundle) — Hip and ridge caps for pitches 8/12 AND ABOVE
- **Brava Solids** ($64.82/bundle) — Solid tiles for valley cuts, edges, detail work
- **Brava Delivery** ($5,000/flat) — Freight delivery to job site. ALWAYS include when Brava is selected.

### Pitch Rule
- If predominant pitch >= 8/12: Select **Brava H&R High Slope**
- If predominant pitch < 8/12: Select **Brava H&R** (regular)
- NEVER select both H&R variants on the same building

## Underlayment
- **OC Titanium PSU 30** — ALWAYS (per universal rules)
- **SolarHide Radiant Barrier** ($340/roll) — ALWAYS for Brava (non-metal), IN ADDITION to PSU 30
- Do NOT select Sharkskin (replaced by SolarHide)
- Do NOT select Grace Ice & Water High Temp as primary underlayment
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (that's metal only)

## Fasteners
- **1.75" Coil Nails RS HDG** ($188/box) — Ring shank, hot-dip galvanized for standard applications
- **1.75" SS RS Coil Nail** ($350/box) — Stainless steel ring shank for coastal/high-moisture (use if specified)
- **3" Coil Screws (H&R)** ($60/box) — For hip and ridge cap attachment

## Labor
- **Default crew: Hugo**
- Select Hugo rate based on predominant pitch:
  - Hugo (standard): $550/sq for pitches below 8/12
  - Hugo (lower pitch): $650/sq for 8/12 to 11/12
  - Hugo (12/12 pitch): $750/sq for 12/12 pitch roofs
- Only select Alfredo ($1,136/sq), Chris ($750/sq), or Sergio ($129/sq) if explicitly specified in job description

## Flashing Options

### Standard Flashings
- D-Style Eave ($46/ea), D-Style Rake ($46/ea)
- Valley ($83/ea), Step Flash ($365/box)
- Headwall or Pitch Change ($36/ea)
- Hip & Ridge ($25/ea) — metal hip/ridge trim

Always use standard aluminum flashing. Copper flashing is only used if the customer explicitly requests it.

Do NOT select Flat Sheet unless explicitly requested — it is for custom fabrication only.

## Snow Retention
- **Snow Guard** ($7.00/ea) — Individual snow guards
  - Guards per row = eave_length (1 per foot)
  - Rows: 1-4/12 = 1, 5-7/12 = 2, 8-10/12 = 3, 11-12/12 = 4
  - Total = guards_per_row × number_of_rows
- Labor: **Snowguard Install** ($5.00/ea)
- Do NOT use snow fence (ColorGard) — that's for metal roofs only

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do NOT select DaVinci products alongside Brava (one system per building)
- Do NOT forget Brava Delivery ($5,000)
- Do NOT select regular H&R when pitch is >= 8/12 (must use High Slope)
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (metal only underlayment)
