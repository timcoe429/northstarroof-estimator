## Calculated Accessories

### Heat Tape (All Systems)
Formula:
- triangles = CEILING(eave_length / 3)
- eave_cable = triangles ├ù 6 LF (3' up + 3' down per triangle)
- valley_cable = valley_length (full straight run)
- total_LF = eave_cable + valley_cable
- Material: Heat Tape at $5.00/LF
- Labor: Heat Tape Install at $7.50/LF

### Skylights (Optional)
- $2,400 each ΓÇö manual count entry

## Financial Rules
- Sales tax: 10% on materials ONLY (not labor or equipment)
- Margin, waste %, office overhead %, sundries % ΓÇö set per estimate by user
- Vendor quote items are READ-ONLY (quantities and prices from quote are source of truth)

## Quantity Calculation (from RoofScope)
- 1 square (SQ) = 100 square feet
- Starter quantity: (eave_length + rake_length) / coverage
- Valley quantity: valley_length / coverage
- Eave/Drip quantity: eave_length / coverage
- Rake quantity: rake_length / coverage
- Ridge/H&R quantity: (ridge_length + hip_length) / coverage
- Flat fee items (delivery, fuel, porto, debris haulaway): quantity = 1 unless specified
