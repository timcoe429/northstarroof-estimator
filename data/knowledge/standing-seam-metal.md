# Standing Seam Metal Roof System

## Overview
Standing seam metal roofs use factory-fabricated panels with concealed fasteners. Material pricing comes from vendor quotes (primarily Schafer & Co.), NOT from the standard price list. This is the only system where a vendor quote is REQUIRED for accurate material pricing.

## Vendor Quote Workflow
1. Upload RoofScope for measurements
2. Upload Schafer & Co. quote PDF ΓÇö AI extracts ALL line items with exact quantities and prices
3. Vendor items are READ-ONLY (cannot edit quantities or prices ΓÇö the quote IS the quote)
4. System adds labor, equipment, and margin on top of vendor materials

Additional vendor quotes may include:
- **TRA Snow & Sun** ΓÇö snow fence systems
- **Rocky Mountain Snow Guards** ΓÇö NOT typically used for metal (snow fence preferred)

## Underlayment
- **OC Titanium PSU 30** ΓÇö ALWAYS (per universal rules)
- **GAF VersaShield** ($200/roll) ΓÇö ALWAYS for metal roofs, IN ADDITION to PSU 30
  - This is a Class A fire-rated underlayment required under metal panels
- Do NOT select SolarHide Radiant Barrier for metal roofs

## Fasteners
- Fasteners come from the Schafer vendor quote (panel clips, pancake screws, pop rivets, woodgrip, lap tek)
- Do NOT select nail items from the standard price list for metal roofs

## Flashing
- All flashing comes from Schafer vendor quote (fab eave, rake, ridge, valley, headwall, sidewall, starter, CZ, transition, drip edge, z-flash, parapet)
- Do NOT select standard aluminum or copper flashing items for metal roofs
- Schafer flashing items are grouped into a "Custom Fabricated Metal Flashing" kit on the proposal

## Snow Retention
- **Snow Fence (ColorGard)** at $12.00/LF ΓÇö ALWAYS for metal roofs
  - Metal roofs ALWAYS get snow fence, never individual snow guards
  - Rows based on pitch: 1-4/12 = 1 row, 5-7/12 = 2 rows, 8-10/12 = 3 rows, 11-12/12 = 4 rows
  - Total LF = eave_length ├ù number_of_rows
- Labor: Snow Fence Install at $5.00/LF

## AG Panel Variant
- AG Panel is an exposed-fastener metal panel (different from standing seam)
- Uses Schafer items: AG Panel 26ga SMP, Foam Closures (inside/outside), Lap Tek screws
- Fab items may differ: Schafer Fab Rake AG Panel, Schafer Fab Side Wall AG Panel
- Same underlayment rules as standing seam

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do NOT select Brava or DaVinci products when a metal vendor quote is uploaded
- Do NOT select standard aluminum flashing ΓÇö all flashing comes from Schafer
- Do NOT select individual snow guards (RMSG Yeti) ΓÇö metal roofs use snow fence
- Do NOT recalculate vendor quote quantities ΓÇö use exact values from the quote
