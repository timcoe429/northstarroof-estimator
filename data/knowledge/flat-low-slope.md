# Flat / Low Slope Roof System

## Overview
Low slope and flat roofs (pitch below 2/12) use modified bitumen or single-ply membrane systems. Different materials and installation methods than steep-slope systems. Common on commercial sections, additions, or porches in the Roaring Fork Valley.

## Primary Materials
- **Low Slope Base Sheet** ($119/roll) ΓÇö Modified bitumen base layer
- **Low Slope Cap** ($116/roll) ΓÇö Modified bitumen cap sheet, granulated surface (top layer)
- These two are the minimum for a modified bitumen system

## Underlayment
- **OC Titanium PSU 30** ΓÇö ALWAYS (per universal rules), used as initial layer
- Do NOT select SolarHide Radiant Barrier for flat roofs (not applicable)
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield for flat roofs (metal only)
- **Grace Ice & Water High Temp** ($157/roll) ΓÇö May be appropriate for flat/low slope areas as additional waterproofing

## Fasteners
- **1.25" Plasticap Pail** ($40/pail) ΓÇö For securing base sheet
- **7/8" Gun Nail** ($28.95/box) ΓÇö For sheathing/substrate

## Flashing
Standard aluminum flashing:
- D-Style Eave ($46/ea) ΓÇö if applicable
- Headwall or Pitch Change ($36/ea)
- Flat Sheet ($120/ea) ΓÇö for custom details and edge work
- Note: Flat roofs often need more custom flashing work than steep roofs

## Snow Retention
- Snow guards/fence are generally NOT needed on flat/low slope roofs
- Snow accumulates rather than slides on low pitches
- Heat tape may still be needed at drainage points and scuppers

## Drainage
- Flat roofs require proper drainage ΓÇö scuppers, internal drains, or crickets
- The estimator should account for any drainage components if mentioned in job description

## Special Considerations
- Low slope requires different labor skills ΓÇö verify crew capability
- Modified bitumen is torch-applied or self-adhering ΓÇö affects labor time
- Warranty requirements may differ from steep-slope systems
- Often combined with steep-slope systems on the same property (e.g., flat porch roof + steep main roof)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do NOT select steep-slope products (Brava, DaVinci, shingles) for flat sections
- Do NOT select snow fence or snow guards for flat/low slope
- Do NOT forget that flat roofs often appear as secondary structures alongside steep roofs
