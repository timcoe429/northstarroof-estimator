# DaVinci Synthetic Shake Roof System

## Overview
DaVinci Multi-Width Shake is a synthetic cedar shake product. Realistic wood appearance with composite durability, Class A fire rated. Premium residential product.

## Primary Materials
- **DaVinci Multi-Width Shake** ($87.55/bundle) — Main roofing material
- **DaVinci Starter** ($80.65/bundle) — Starter course along eaves and rakes
- **DaVinci H&R Hinged** ($97.50/bundle) — Hip and ridge caps (hinged design for steep slopes)

### Note on Pitch
- DaVinci H&R Hinged is the only H&R option — it works on all pitches due to its hinged design
- Unlike Brava, there is no separate "high slope" variant

## Underlayment
- **OC Titanium PSU 30** — ALWAYS (per universal rules)
- **SolarHide Radiant Barrier** ($340/roll) — ALWAYS for DaVinci (non-metal), IN ADDITION to PSU 30
- Do NOT select Sharkskin (replaced by SolarHide)
- Do NOT select Grace Ice & Water High Temp as primary underlayment
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (metal only)

## Fasteners
- **1.75" Coil Nails RS HDG** ($188/box) — Ring shank for synthetic systems
- **1.75" SS RS Coil Nail** ($350/box) — Stainless steel option if specified
- **3" Coil Screws (H&R)** ($60/box) — For hip and ridge attachment
- **1.25" Plasticap Pail** ($40/pail) — For underlayment

## Flashing Options

### Standard Flashings
- D-Style Eave ($46/ea), D-Style Rake ($46/ea)
- Valley ($83/ea), Step Flash ($365/box)
- Headwall or Pitch Change ($36/ea), Flat Sheet ($120/ea)
- Hip & Ridge ($25/ea)

Always use standard aluminum flashing. Copper flashing is only used if the customer explicitly requests it.

## Snow Retention
- **RMSG Yeti Snowguard** ($7.00/ea) — Same calculation as Brava
  - Guards per row = eave_length (1 per foot)
  - Rows by pitch: 1-4/12 = 1, 5-7/12 = 2, 8-10/12 = 3, 11-12/12 = 4
- Labor: **Snowguard Install** ($5.00/ea)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do NOT select Brava products alongside DaVinci (one system per building)
- Do NOT select GAF VersaShield (metal only)
- DaVinci does NOT have a delivery fee item like Brava does
