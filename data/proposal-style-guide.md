# Proposal Style Guide

This guide helps the AI understand how Northstar Roofing prefers proposals to be organized. These are preferences and examples, not rigid rules — use judgment based on the specific project.

## General Principle

The client should see what they're getting for the big stuff. They don't need to see every screw and rivet. Group small commodity items into logical kits. Keep significant items visible on their own.

## Materials

### Keep as standalone items (roughly $1,500+ or significant products):
- Metal roofing panels (show the actual product: "26ga Standing Seam Metal Panels" not just "Metal Panels")
- Underlayment products (show the product name: "Grace Ice & Water High Temp" or "GAF VersaShield")
- Snow fence / snow retention systems
- Heat tape
- Tile or shingle products (Brava, DaVinci, etc.)
- Any single item over ~$1,500

### Group into kits (small items, commodity items):
- **"Custom Fabricated Metal Flashing"** — groups: eave flashing, rake flashing, ridge cap, valley flashing, headwall, sidewall, any "Fab" items. These are the custom bent pieces Schafer fabricates.
- **"Panel Clips, Fasteners & Hardware"** — groups: panel clips, woodgrip fasteners, lap tek fasteners, pop rivets, stitch screws. All the small metal hardware that holds things together.
- **"Sealants, Tapes & Closures"** — groups: butyl tape, foam closures (inside and outside), caulk/sealant tubes, Nova Seal. Small sealing and finishing materials.

### Kit naming:
- Use clean, professional names a homeowner understands
- Avoid vendor codes and part numbers in kit names
- The kit name should give a sense of what's included

## Labor

Keep each labor item as its own line. Do NOT group labor items together.
- "Complete Roof Installation" or "Roofing Installation"
- "Heat Tape Installation"
- "Snow Fence Installation"
- Each type of work stays separate

## Equipment & Fees

Keep each equipment item as its own line. Do NOT group equipment.
- "Rolloff Dumpster" (not just "Rolloff")
- "Porto Potty"
- "Crane Rental" if applicable
- Each stays separate

## Optional Items

Keep each optional item as its own line. Do NOT group.
- "Skylight" with quantity
- Whatever else is optional stays individual

## Sorting

Within each category, sort by price highest first. The client sees the big items at the top.
